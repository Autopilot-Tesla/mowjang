# Mowjang
Mowjang's website, complies Eaglercraft and such. It is my Username for most servers(blobcraft.club, zentic.cc, mc.asspixel.net, arch.mc.)
I am mostly only online on weekdays, not on the summer or chirstmas. You can find me on Blobcraft most of the time.
Contact me if you need help, I am on Khan Academy(https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/khannyguy/), just find my subpage, or find me on Replit(My username is ChatGPTOpenAI).
Otherwise just message me on blobcraft? Not the best solution.

# Server problems
If you can't go on a server, I know that Asspixel is "down", not sure why. And Arch MC bans you if you are on a network that others are banned on, I am sure. Even if you did nothing wrong, yes.
