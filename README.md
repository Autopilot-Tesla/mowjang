# Mowjang
Mowjang's website, complies Eaglercraft and such. It is my Username for most servers(blobcraft.club, zentic.cc, mc.asspixel.net, arch.mc.)
I am mostly only online on weekdays, not on the summer or chirstmas. You can find me on Blobcraft most of the time.
Contact me if you need help, I am on Khan Academy(https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/khannyguy/), just find my subpage, or find me on Replit(My username is ChatGPTOpenAI).
Otherwise just message me on blobcraft? Not the best solution.

# WARNING:
Do not click any of these links if you don't know what you are doing. And if you know what you are doing, do it reasonably.

By that I mean downloading the files. I warned you.

# NOTE:
Almost every version has the ability to lag. Very very hard. Like, it turns your chromebook screen black once then turns to normal(No harm), but if you have bad wifi...

It likely will say, "This device is not compatible with blah blah blah..." and will show that on the website. If you have good wifi, make sure to play only on non-laggy servers.

# Client
To play Eaglercraft 1.12(.2) just download 'autopilot.html', and open it. Or, go to:

https://autopilot-tesla.github.io/eaglercraftx1-8.github.io/eagler-files/1.12/Main/index.html

There will be alternatives if it does not work just tell me.

# Server problems
I recommend going on blobcraft.club, all I know that is legit. It does lag sometimes.
If you can't go on a server, I know that Asspixel is "down", not sure why. And Arch MC bans you if you are on a network that others are banned on, I am sure. Even if you did nothing wrong, yes.
If you are using different versions, the server ip may be different, search it up.
